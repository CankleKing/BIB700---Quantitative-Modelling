# BIB700---Quantitative-Modelling
A repository that is desgined to model the populations of a host-parasitoid-hyperparasitoid network in randomised spatially explicit landscape. It also contains the begining and a challenge to include dispersal within the model.


The repository consists of three parts, these should be performed in this order:

PART A - Parameters, Model & Simulation:
Here the landscape, population function and model can be run, outputting a large dataset of population values for patches of variable sizes.

PART B - Visualization & Analysis:
Using the dataframe created by PART A, a series of graphs and statistical tests are performed to help visualise and analyse the results of our model.

PART C - Preliminary Dispersal Code:
(BONUS CONTENT) This is non-functional code but can be a good starting point to  develop the model further
